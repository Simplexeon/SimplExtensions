# SimplExtensions
## Reusable Godot Nodes


**This repository contains scenes that can be used in any Godot game, provided you credit me as the creator.**


## How to Use
All you need to do to use these scenes is drag and drop the files into your game directory! The paths to each scene need to be kept the same, so this project has been organized such that it requires the SimplExtensions directory as a base. If you don't need to use certain extensions, you can just remove that folder from the SimplExtensions directory.

All of these scenes have been created in Godot using GDScript, and can be reconfigured in GDScript as well.


## Extensions
- Universal Main Menu (v0.2.0)
