# SimplExtensions
## Reusable Godot Nodes


**This repository contains scenes that can be used in any Godot game, provided you credit me (Simplexeon) as the creator.**


## Extensions
- Universal Main Menu (v0.2.0)
- Transitions Galore (v0.0.1)

## How to Use
All you need to do to use these scenes is drag and drop the files into your game directory! The paths to each scene need to be kept the same, so this project has been organized such that it requires the SimplExtensions directory as a base. If you don't need to use certain extensions, you can just remove that folder from the SimplExtensions directory.

All of these scenes have been created in Godot using GDScript, and can be reconfigured in GDScript as well.

### Universal Main Menu
UMM has a bunch of different settings and standard things that anyone might want in a main menu. Buttons that change scenes, open links, and it all resizes based on the project's window size!

Features:
 - Title
 - Scene change buttons
 - Link opening buttons
 - Tiled scrolling backgrounds
 - Static backgrounds

*Note: This works best with unresizeable windows or viewport-style windows. Otherwise, you will need to change some things manually.*

### Transitions Galore
TG is a universal transition node that applies to any screen size. It allows you to control the speed and allows you to reverse the animation. There are a variety of preset animations to choose from made using Godot Shader Language.

Preset Transitions:
 - Expanding Circle
 - And more coming soon! (yeah, just one so far)


## ToDo

 - Implement transition functionality to UMM
 - Fade to black transition
 - Screen wipe transition
